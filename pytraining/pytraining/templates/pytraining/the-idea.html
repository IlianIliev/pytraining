    <h1>{% trans 'The idea' %}</h1>
    <p>The idea here is to train and expand your Python knowledge by completing
    simple programing and/or logic tasks. Each task should not take more than
    30 minutes including preparation - e.g. installing additional package or
    basic setup. Of course this is without claculating "thinking" time )</p>
    <p>Tasks can have hints - e.g. "Check the itertools module." or "Have you
    ever head about timedelta?"</p>
    <p>Users will be able to comment on tasks comparing their solutions with
    others, seeking advice etc. </p>
